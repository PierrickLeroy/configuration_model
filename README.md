# network_generation
A repo to generate and modify networks based on classical models

# Motivation
This repo is motivated by two goals. First, it is a good way to become familiar with these models and understand deeply how they work. Efficiency in implementation is a secondary objective, however optimized versions of all of these models probably exist already.
Secondly, I plan to use these models to design tasks for experimentations on GNN. Being able to generate syntethic datasets helps for benchmarking algorithms. Furthermore, it will be easy to adapt the models to have variations that best suit my experimental needs.

# Available implementations
- [x] configuration model
- [x] barabasi-albert model
- [ ] copying model
- [ ] hidden parameter model
- [ ] affiliation network model
- [ ] random network
